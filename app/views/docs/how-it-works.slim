    # How it works

    #{SITENAME} is a cloud control panel. We provide the graphical interface, data
    storage, and API for the individual settings of pods of users.

    The stored settings can be retrieved via JSON at hashed URLs, automatically
    generated by the #{SITENAME} JavaScript library.

    ## How is it secure?

    ### Rolling dual-key link hashes

    When one of your users clicks on a link to the control panel, #{SITENAME}
    creates a secure link in realtime that accesses their settings. Additionaly,
    this dynamic link only works when accessed from the domains you approve.
